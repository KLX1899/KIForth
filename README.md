# KIForth
This is my university project. creation a Forth interpreter by C.

This project was described by Ahmad Siavashi(https://github.com/ahmad-siavashi) and the reason for its name is: kalaKI + Forth = KIForth

To do this project, I used gforth 0.7.3 compiler and I have tried to design the interpreter similar to gforth so that it is easier to work with it.

There are two ways to work with the gforth compiler:
1. Installing it
https://gforth.org/

2. Online compiler

I will add more documentation and explanations to the repository as the project progresses. ;)
